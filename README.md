# Dbc Overflow

DBC Overflow provides a single location for all questions/concerns and answers about DBC life/studies/preparation for potential applicants of DBC or current Phase 0 DBC students. Questions, answers, and comments on either can be voted on, and the question asker can select a "best" answer.

DBC Overflow is a clone of Stack Overflow made as part of a group project in Week 7 of Dev Bootcamp.

Group members include: [Quentin Devauchelle](https://github.com/Qt-dev), [Matthew Knudsen](https://github.com/mknudsen01), [Hunter Paull](https://github.com/hpchess), [Armando Reed](https://github.com/trekkie4life), and [Chermaine Zimmerman](https://github.com/c14jcdj)
